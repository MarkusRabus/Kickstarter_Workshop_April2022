The most comprehensive source for documentation about Jupyter Notebooks is https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io, but there are many great beginner-level tutorials and demos out there. Usually a web search of a question, like \"how to make a table in markdown jupyter notebook\", will yield several good examples -- and if you're not already familiar with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">StackOverflow</a>, you may find yourself to be soon. ðŸ˜„\n",
